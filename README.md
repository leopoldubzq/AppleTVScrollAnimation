# ðŸ“± Apple TV+ Style Scrolling Effect in SwiftUI

Recreation of the **Apple TV+ horizontal scrolling effect** in SwiftUI. This subtle horizontal shift adds depth and dynamics to the interface, making it visually more engaging.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Smooth horizontal scrolling effect  
- âœ… Dynamic image shifting based on scroll offset  
- âœ… Clean and lightweight SwiftUI implementation  
- âœ… Inspired by Apple TV+ app design  

## ðŸ§© How It Works

The key is using **`GeometryReader`** to track the viewâ€™s position along the X-axis and applying a negative offset:

```swift
.offset(x: -minX * 0.6) // Creates a 3D-like scrolling effect
```

With this simple line, you achieve a slight image shift in the opposite direction of the scroll, adding a 3D-like depth to your UI. ðŸ”¥
